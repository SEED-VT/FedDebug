# Badges Requested: `Artifacts Evaluated: Functional`, `Reusable` and `Available`.

### `Functional` and `Reusable`

- We have provided clear documentation for setting up and using `FedDebug` for anyone. Not only is the code `functional`, but we have also made extra efforts to make the results of `FedDebug` easily reproducible online.

- Although the local setup is completely functional (details are provided in `INSTALL.md`), we generalize `FedDebug` and make it available for anyone running it on `Google-Colab` with `Jupyter Notebooks` to assist users who do not have access to a `GPU` for the facilitation of reuse and re-purposing.

- We provide a `FedDebug fault localization technique` in a separate package so that users can use it with any other Federated Learning library with its benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide Docker support to quickly interact with `FedDebug Debugging constructs` in no time.  

- Complete documentation, including `readme.md` and code comments, is available for reference.

- The `artifact.ipynb` notebook provides a single interface for testing and reproducing the results discussed in the `FedDebug` paper for **verification** and **validation** purposes.

### `Artifacts Available`

All of our artifacts can be found at https://github.com/SEED-VT/FedDebug.

> We have made every effort to ensure that `FedDebug` is both `functional` and `reusable` for all users.  As the ***first open-source debugger*** for federated learning applications with fault localization capabilities, we believe that `FedDebug` will open up new possibilities for debugging and testing in FL in the future.
