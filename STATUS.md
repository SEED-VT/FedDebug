### `Functional` and `Resuable`

- We have provided clear documentation for setting up and using `FedDebug` for anyone. Not only is the code `functional`, but we have also made extra efforts to make the results of `FedDebug` easily reproducible online.


- Although locally setup is completely functional (details are provided in `INSTALL.md`), we genralize `FedDebug` and make it avaiable for anyone running it on `Google-Colab` with `Jupyter Notebooks` to assist users who do not have access to a `GPU` for the faciliton of reuse and repurposing.

- We provide a `FedDebug fault locazliaiton technique` in a separate package so that users can use it with any other Federated Learning library with its benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide docker support to quickly interact with `FedDebug Debugging constructs` in no time.

- Complete documentation, including `readme.md` and code comments, is available for reference.

- The `artifact.ipynb` notebook provides a single interface for testing and reproducing the results discussed in the `FedDebug` paper for **verification** and **validation** purposes.


  
###  `Artifacts Available`
All of our artifacts can be found at https://github.com/SEED-VT/FedDebug.

  

> We have made every effort to ensure that `FedDebug` is both

> debugger*** for federated learning applications with fault
> localization capabilities, we believe that `FedDebug` will open up new
> possibilities for debugging and testing in FL in future.

<!-- # Badges Requested: `Functional`, `Reusable` and `Available`.

  
  
  

A `Docker Image` . Additionally, We also offer support through Docker to interact with `FedDebug` debugging constructs. -->

  
  
  

<!-- - `Documented`: Complete documention is avaiable in form of `readme.md` and comments in the code.

  

- `Consistent`: The `artifact.ipynb` notebook provides single point interface to `exercise` and `reproduce` the complete results of different configurations discussed in the paper (`FedDebug`) for the `verificaiton` and `validation` of results. -->

  

<!-- - `Complete`: We have ensured each and every file is running and made avaiable in this repository.

  

- `Exercisable`: `fed-debug` stores data in the for disk-cache and can be used to generate any analytic reports. -->
