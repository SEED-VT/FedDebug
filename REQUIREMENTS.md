In order to evaluate the artifacts of FedDebug, it is recommended that the user have a basic understanding of Python, Google Colab, and Docker. To evaluate the artifact on a local machine, knowledge of Jupyter Notebooks, Unix OS, and Python virtual environments (e.g., Anaconda) is required. However, familiarity with Google Colab is enough to engage with FedDebug's fault localization module. Access to either an Nvidia GPU or Google Colab is also required. The package can be installed using conda and pip. Additional information regarding the simulation environment can be found in Section 5 of the accompanying research paper.
